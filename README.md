# aqua_pendulum_clock
The project contains a pendulum clock attached to a vertical aquarium underneath with 3 ball-headed pendulums hanging from varying length chains, 3 fish swimming around inside, a bubble generator locating at the center of its ground blowing out bubbles which make sounds and an info-instructions panel on the right-hand side of the window.
